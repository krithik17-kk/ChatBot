Chatbot using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

-Overview :

This project is a simple, interactive chatbot built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The chatbot can simulate conversation with users and provide predefined responses to their queries. This project demonstrates the basics of front-end web development and how JavaScript can be used to create dynamic interactions.

-Features :

Responsive UI: Designed using HTML and styled with CSS for a clean and responsive layout.

Real-time Interaction: Uses JavaScript to handle user input and simulate responses.

Predefined Responses: The chatbot is programmed with a set of predefined responses based on keywords or commands typed by the user.

Mobile-Friendly: The chatbot interface is fully responsive and can be used on mobile devices.

-Technologies Used :

HTML5: For structuring the chatbot UI.

CSS3: For styling the interface and making it visually appealing.

JavaScript (ES6): For handling the chatbot logic, managing conversations, and interacting with the user.

-Project Structure :

index.html: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the chatbot interface.

style.css: The CSS file that styles the chatbot's UI elements such as chatbox, input fields, and buttons.

script.js: The JavaScript file that handles user input, chatbot responses, and the chat interaction.

-How it Works:

User Input: The user types a message in the input box.

JavaScript Handling: JavaScript captures the input and processes it.

Predefined Responses: Based on the input, the chatbot gives a relevant response from its predefined set of answers.

Display: The chatbot's response is displayed in the chat window for the user to read.

-How to Run the Project :

Clone this repository or download the project files.

Open the index.html file in your browser.

Type your messages in the input field and click "Send" to interact with the chatbot.

-Future Enhancements :

Add more advanced responses using natural language processing (NLP).

Implement a backend with Node.js to handle more dynamic interactions.

Integrate the chatbot with third-party APIs to provide real-time data.
